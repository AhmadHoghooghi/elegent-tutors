to be able to register to os clipboards from vim, vim should be compiled with feature called clipboard. to check it run command below and assure clipboard has + sign next to it.

vim --version | grep clipboard.

or run this command inside vim:
:echo has('clipboard')

fedoras default vim does not have this feature, so I removed it and installed xvim.

There are two registers that are synced with Os clipboards
"* is synced with Os primary clipboard (called x11-selection) (wchich is field with selection and can be accessed with mouse middle key. (or "*p in vim)

"+ which is CLIPBOARD and is filled with ctrl-c or ctrl-x and can be accessed with ctrl-v in os (or "+p in vim)

in a vim with clipboard feature,

register to x11-selection with "*y and paste with "*p
register to os clipboard with "+y and paste with "+p in other vim or ctrl-c in other window
